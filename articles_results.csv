ASX set for sluggish start as it kicks off new trading week,https://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/asx-set-for-sluggish-start-as-it-kicks-off-new-trading-week-20251019-p5n3nh.html,"ASX futures edged down 7 points, or less than 0.1 per cent, to 9003, pointing to a dip when trading opens this morning. The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent, as did the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite. It had come into the day with a loss of roughly 30 per cent since mid-September.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4 per cent from 3.99 per cent late on Thursday."

But this probably isn't a demotion, not after only one game, and not after you see that Sogaard isn't off to a great start either. In the meantime, the Sens just need him for practice and to wear the ball cap on the bench in Ottawa. Based on his two games so far in the AHL, his current .864 save percentage isn’t exactly a statistic that demanded an immediate call-up to the NHL.

The Main Difference Between Algorithmic And AI Trading? Human Control,https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesfinancecouncil/2025/10/17/the-main-difference-between-algorithmic-and-ai-trading-human-control/,"Independent investors often use the terms ""algorithmic trading"" and ""AI trading"" interchangeably, but the two are actually completely different. Algorithmic trading is a rule-based system where humans set the parameters in advance. With algorithmic trading, you maintain control. AI simply doesn't have the decades-long track record of algorithmic trading, and I believe many people are overestimating its current capabilities.
